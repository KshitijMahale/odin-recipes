    <h3>Description</h3>
    <!-- <p>A fragrant and spicy classic Indian chicken dish with a silky tomato cream sauce. Indian Comfort Food!</p> -->
    <p>Butter chicken like chicken tikka masala, is one of the most popular Indian curries across the world and for all the right reasons. This delicious chicken recipe is also popular by its Hindi name - murgh makhani. The taste of the creamy bright coloured masala with chunks of grilled chicken in it is an unforgettable one and I love mine with some soft rumali rotis, though you can have it with any kind of Indian flatbread too. Like its north Indian origins and name itself suggests good quantities of butter go into the making of this dish. One taste and you are going to wow that this is the best butter chicken you have ever had.</p>
